## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Basic code setup

```{r}
getwd()
retail_master <- retail
```

- set.seed()

```{r}
daerah <- c("Bogor", "Jakarta", "Depok", "Bandung")
set.seed(1908)
sample(daerah, 1)
```



```{r}
set.seed(100)
idx <- sample(nrow(retail), nrow(retail)*0.6)
retail60 <- retail[idx]
```

- xtabs()

```{r}
agg1 <- xtabs(formula = Profit ~ Category + Segment, data = retail)
agg1
heatmap(agg1)
plot(agg1, main = "Plot Segment V Category")

```

```{r}
exer <- xtabs(formula = Sales ~ Segment + Ship.Mode, data = retail)
exer
plot(exer, main = "Plot Ship.Mode V Segment")
```

- aggregate()

```{r}
aggregate(formula = Profit ~ Segment, data = retail, FUN = mean)
```

```{r}
aggregate(formula = Sales ~ Segment + Category, data = retail, FUN = max)
```

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
